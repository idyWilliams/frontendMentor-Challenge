- CSS PROPERTIES

### What I learned
 This is my first frontend challenge. it was quite stressing at first but after a while i was able to sort some things out my own way. it might not be the best copy so far. But i promise one day i'll be a professional in this field.  Thank you.
 Initially i was thinking of using css flexbox for the challenge. but i had to introduce css positioning in other to centralize the box. the parameters where quite tricky to come by. 
 Basically i learnt that is just creativity. another person might decide to go about it using a different approach and arrive at a better result result, i just had to use what i knew  as at time of writting taking this challenge to create it. i'm still learning aand i'm open to mentorship and guidiance as i work towards improving myself daily. 


### Continued development

I am still working on my Html and css.. i have not started reading about javascript and other frameworks just yet. i started my tech journey two weeks from the day i took this challenge. i am still studying to improve myself ore anad more
